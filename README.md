# Introduction 
This repository contains one TypeScript class with an example of SOLID principles.

# Precondition
Make sure that you read the TypeScript documentation located here: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/ .    
TypeScript is using node.js, so it will be good to have a basic knowledge of it: https://nodejs.org/en/ .  
For any questions, refer to the original documentation.

# Getting Started
Please follow the steps to set up the project:  
### Installation process
1. Clone the repository.
2. If you don't have Node.js - download and install it: https://nodejs.org/en/ (LTS version).
3. Open the project from your IDE. The IDE should have installed TypeScript. I prefer to use Visual Studio Code - which comes with installed TypeScript.
4. Navigate to the project root folder from the terminal.
5. We need to compile the .ts file to the .js file. To do that, execute the following command in the terminal:
> tsc
8. Now we need to execute the .js file. To do that, execute the following command in the terminal:
> node solid-example.js

# Contribute
